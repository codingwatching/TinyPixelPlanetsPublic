# Tiny Pixel Planets TU3 Godot 4.1 branch (unstable)
This branch is for finally updating Tiny Pixel Planets from godot 3 to 4. This will allow the game to use many features that are unique to godot 4, while also boosting performance.
Currently this branch is on Tiny Pixel Planets Title update 3 beta 3, so main will not be updated to Godot 4 even after this branch is complete as I will have to finish Title update 3 after upgrading.
